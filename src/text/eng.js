	"services.web_description": "I have been designing websites since I was 14 (I'll give you a hint....that was more than 20 years ago!).  The industry and process has changed dramatically since I started dabbling with Macromedia Dreamweaver as a teenager!  I'm just as excited and inspired to make web content now as I ever was. I love meeting the challenge of creating fast-loading, good-looking, client-focused and easily-maintainable applications that work beautifully on all devices. I am a full-stack developer specialising in React and Node (among numerous other technologies).",
	"services.software": "Software",
	"services.software_description": "My skills are not limited to creating web content. I also make software. From a very simple admin automation script (e.g. an invoice maker) to a full-featured client records system, I can bring it to life for you. Modern, automated, reliable and secure bespoke software is more readily available and affordable then you may think. I can take the pain away from your time-draining manual admin",
	"services.mobile": "Mobile",
	"services.mobile_description": "This is the latest skill I have acquired and it's probably the one that currently excites me the most. Using the React Native framework, I can take your app idea from concept to design, development and final delivery to the relevant app stores. Thanks to the versatility of React Native, your apps will be cross-platform (they will work on iOS and Android).",
